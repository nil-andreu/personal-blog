# Personal Blog
In this personal blog application, I will handle blog posts, my portfolio, as well as my professional online profile.
It is developed following the Test-Driven Development principles, both unit tests and integration tests.

Some of the most relevant technos I am using are the following.
## GitHub Actions
To automate the test on when pushing the code to the respository.

I am testing both:
- Functionality: that the code is working well
- Code Quality: automating checks of the code quality and persistance

## Docker
I am using Docker to containerize my application, so it can be easily deployed on a server.
